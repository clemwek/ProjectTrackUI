## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ProjectTrackUI.git
   ```
2. Open the Xcode project:

   ```bash
   cd ProjectTrackUI/ProjectTrackUI.xcodeproj
   open ProjectTrackUI.xcodeproj
   ```
3. Build and run on the simulator or a physical device.

## Usage

1. Launch the app to land on the Home tab, which lists current projects.
2. Navigate to **New Project** to add a project by specifying a title, description, and deadline.
3. View project **Progress** to see completion status and milestones.
4. Manage your user details under **Profile**.

## Architecture

* **SwiftUI**: Declarative UI framework for all screens and views.
